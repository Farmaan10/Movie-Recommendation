# Movie Recommendation System
Movie recommendation system has become an interesting research topic due to the growth of users in a mobile environment. To recommend movies, a complete aggregation of userâ€™s preferences, feelings (emotions), and reviews required to assist users for find best movies in more convenient way. In this project, the method is based on extracting and analysing adjectives from user-based reviews. We exploit the idea that adjectives often contain a sentiment, and present a system entirely based on adjectives as sentiment deciders.

## How Cosine Similarity works?
  Cosine similarity is a metric used to measure how similar the documents are irrespective of their size. Mathematically, it measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors projected in a multi-dimensional space. The cosine similarity is advantageous because even if the two similar documents are far apart by the Euclidean distance (due to the size of the document), chances are they may still be oriented closer together. The smaller the angle, higher the cosine similarity.
